## Lessons Learned

This was my first project with Firebase, Redux, Redux Saga, Redux Persist, Redux Thunk and Styled Components. It gave me a broader view of React.js architecture and how to think and structure a bigger application.

## Appendix

I used [DALL.E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to generate the images for the shop and also [Clove](https://goclove.com/products/clove-shoe-womens-grey-matter) for the sneakers.
